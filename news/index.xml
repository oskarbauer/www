If you are looking at the master branch, you might be asking why we didn&amp;rsquo;t commit anything for the last weeks?
It&amp;rsquo;s because we are havily working on the plgd cloud 2.0! There will be more detailed post about new features and changes, but to give you some insights into what you can expect:
rapid memory optimization optimized device connection handling new event store model designed together with the MongoDB team optimized database writes and commands handling service configuration in YAML files deployment using a HELM chart plgd Dashboard and much more &amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>plgd bundle available</title><link>https://plgd.dev/news/bundle-available/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://plgd.dev/news/bundle-available/</guid><description>As you&amp;rsquo;ve might already experienced, the plgd cloud consist of a few scalable services which are in the production environment deployed and scaled independently. This deployment complexity is very often a pain point for device developers who are using the plgd cloud just to verify their device API implementation and its behavior.
