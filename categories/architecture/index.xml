As the component diagram describes, responsibilities of the gateway are:
handle and maintain TCP connections comming from devices forward authentication and authorization requests (see 5.5.5) to the Authorization Service process device CRUDN operations which are by its nature forwarded to the Resource Aggregate or Resource Directory Operational flow Before a device becomes operational and is able to interact with other devices, it needs to be appropriately onboarded.</description></item><item><title>Domain Overview</title><link>https://next.plgd.dev/architecture/introduction/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/architecture/introduction/</guid><description>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, which are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity for the purpose of enabling these things to connect and exchange data. Thus creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, resulting in efficiency improvements, economic benefits and reduced human intervention. (Wikipedia, Internet of Things)
In other words, an IoT device is regularly subject to change, since it represents the world around it.</description></item><item><title>System Overview</title><link>https://next.plgd.dev/architecture/system-overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/architecture/system-overview/</guid><description>System Context Diagram plgd Context Diagram</description></item></channel></rss>
