For testing purposes, the external OAuth Server (e.g. Auth0) can be set up. To skip the internal mocked OAuth Server and switch to your external one, configure the following environment variables:

The plgd API will be based on this value to identify the user and grant him the permissions only to devices he owns. By default, JWT claim sub is used as the owner ID. In case you connect the plgd authorization service with the Auth0, each logged-in user can access only his devices. This behaviour can be changed by changing the OWNER_CLAIM configuration property and adding custom claim to your Auth0 users.</description></item></channel></rss>
