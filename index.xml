As the component diagram describes, responsibilities of the gateway are:
handle and maintain TCP connections comming from devices forward authentication and authorization requests (see 5.5.5) to the Authorization Service process device CRUDN operations which are by its nature forwarded to the Resource Aggregate or Resource Directory Operational flow Before a device becomes operational and is able to interact with other devices, it needs to be appropriately onboarded.</description></item><item><title>Domain Overview</title><link>https://next.plgd.dev/architecture/introduction/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/architecture/introduction/</guid><description>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, which are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity for the purpose of enabling these things to connect and exchange data. Thus creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, resulting in efficiency improvements, economic benefits and reduced human intervention. (Wikipedia, Internet of Things)
In other words, an IoT device is regularly subject to change, since it represents the world around it.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://next.plgd.dev/introduction/faq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/introduction/faq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>System Overview</title><link>https://next.plgd.dev/architecture/system-overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/architecture/system-overview/</guid><description>System Context Diagram plgd Context Diagram</description></item><item><title>What is plgd</title><link>https://next.plgd.dev/introduction/what-is-plgd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/introduction/what-is-plgd/</guid><description>What are the biggest problems in IoT?

If you are looking at the master branch, you might be asking why we didn&amp;rsquo;t commit anything for the last weeks?
It&amp;rsquo;s because we are havily working on the plgd cloud 2.0! There will be more detailed post about new features and changes, but to give you some insights into what you can expect:
rapid memory optimization optimized device connection handling new event store model designed together with the MongoDB team optimized database writes and commands handling service configuration in YAML files deployment using a HELM chart plgd Dashboard and much more &amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>plgd bundle available</title><link>https://next.plgd.dev/news/bundle-available/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/news/bundle-available/</guid><description>As you&amp;rsquo;ve might already experienced, the plgd cloud consist of a few scalable services which are in the production environment deployed and scaled independently. This deployment complexity is very often a pain point for device developers who are using the plgd cloud just to verify their device API implementation and its behavior.
To make the experience with the usage of the plgd cloud perfect to everyone, we have created a new package - plgd bundle docker container which bundles all plgd core services and more:</description></item><item><title>First certified Cloud-to-Cloud solution</title><link>https://next.plgd.dev/news/ocf-first-certified-cloud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/news/ocf-first-certified-cloud/</guid><description>Just few days after releasing new OCF Universal Cloud Interface, first OCF Member Haier Group certifies their IoT cloud solution. Certification tool used by the OCF as well as the robustness of the OCF UCI specification is verified by the publicly announced reference implementation plgd!
Yes, we are now officialy part of this, making the IoT more secure and available to all of you!

Reference implementation &amp;ldquo;plgd&amp;rdquo; (pronounced &amp;ldquo;plugged&amp;rdquo;), available at https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud, is a cloud native IoT platform which fulfils the above needs and more.
This and much more was written by the Open Connectivity Foundation about us in just recently published OCF UCI white paper!</description></item><item><title/><link>https://next.plgd.dev/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://next.plgd.dev/readme/</guid><description>Introduction What are the biggest problems in IoT?
