Resource Directory maintains projection of devices which were requested by clients through the plgd gateways.

## Docker Image

```bash
docker pull plgd/resource-directory:latest
```

## YAML Configuration

A configuration template is available on [resource-directory/config.yaml](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/resource-directory/config.yaml).

### Public Configuration

These configurations are `Coap Cloud Conf` information for device registration to plgd cloud as well as root CA certificate, certificate authority address to get identity certificate for ssl connection to plgd cloud before device registration.
This will be served by HTTP Gateway API as defined [here](https://github.com/plgd-dev/cloud/blob/v2/http-gateway/uri/uri.go#L14) and also see [cloud-configuration](https://try.plgd.cloud/.well-known/cloud-configuration).

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| `publicConfiguration.caPool` | string | `File path to root CA which was used to sign coap-gw certificate.` | `""` |
| `publicConfiguration.ownerClaim` | string | `Claim used to identify owner of the device.` | `"sub"` |
| `publicConfiguration.deviceIdClaim` | string | `Claim used to identify device id of the device. Empty means that JWT doesn't contain it.` | `""` |
| `publicConfiguration.signingServerAddress` | string | `Address of certificate authority for plgd-dev/sdk.` | `""` |
| `publicConfiguration.cloudID` | string | `Cloud ID which is stored in coap-gw certificate.` | `""` |
| `publicConfiguration.cloudURL` | string | `Cloud URL for onboard device.` | `""` |
| `publicConfiguration.cloudAuthorizationProvider` | string | `OAuth authorization provider for onboard device.` | `""` |
| `publicConfiguration.defaultCommandTimeToLive` | string | `Exposes default command time to live for CreateResource, RetrieveResource, UpdateResource, DeleteResource, and UpdateDeviceMetadata commands when it is not set in the request. 0s - means forever.` | `"0s"` |
| `publicConfiguration.authorizationServer` | string | `Authority is the address of the token-issuing authentication server. Services will use this URI to find and retrieve the public key that can be used to validate the tokenâ€™s signature. Must be same as in coap-gateway configuration.` | `""` |

> Note that the string type related to time (i.e. timeout, idleConnTimeout, expirationTime) is decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".
